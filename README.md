# S.A.I.N.T.
A Discord bot focused on security, programmed entirely using Discord.js.

The **S**ecure **A**utomated & **I**ntegrated **N**eutralizing **T**ool is a bot focused on Discord server security.
Imagine making a server for the masses, of course you want to protect it against raiders and other unintended users. Sure, Discord's verification levels work just as well, but those are a little bit easy to circumvent. Of course, many people won't have a phone number, so you might want to avoid using the highest verification level if you want to make your server accessible to anyone.

**S.A.I.N.T.** is designed to provide other means of verification for those new people that join your server. It offers your regular old moderation commands, from a purge to delete messages, to a ban command. But it will even offer a verification tool implemented specifically for new members. It's like a swiss knife for Discord servers!

*cough*, Did we mention it has a great knack for memes?
